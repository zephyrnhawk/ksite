			<p>Kelsey Martin (aka bopx)
			 1992, CA</p>
			<p>I'm currently a student studying Visual Development as a Game Design major at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. I communicate well with others and I'm always pushing myself (along with my peers) to keep learning, improving, and growing. As I'm still developing a focus, I continuously develop my skills in every area of design as I try to not limit myself as a concept artist.</p>
			<p>While I've always loved drawing, my deepest passion has been in gaming. I love a game's visual as well as non-visual design, and the wonderful relationship the two create. Out of studying, I enjoy playing games, making props, making costumes, and shooting my friends with paint.</p>
